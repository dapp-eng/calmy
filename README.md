# Calmy: Personal Daily Calorie Tracker

**Calmy** is a functional Python-based application developed to assist users in managing their nutritional health by recording food intake and automatically calculating daily calorie consumption. This project was created as part of the **Introduction to Programming** course at **Universitas Negeri Surabaya (UNESA)**.

## Project Overview
The project was born from the belief that maintaining a healthy diet should be simplified and accessible to everyone. By applying fundamental programming concepts to solve real-world health challenges, **Calmy** serves as a bridge between theoretical logic and everyday practical needs, focusing on transforming data into actionable insights.

## Key Features
* **Automated Calorie Calculation**: Instantly computes daily calorie totals based on user inputs to ensure data accuracy.
* **Detailed Food Logging**: Allows users to input specific food details, including name, calorie count, and unit.
* **Integrated Data Display**: Provides a clear and consolidated overview of daily consumption in a single column for better transparency.
* **Weekly Visual Charts**: Features graphical visualizations using **Kivy** to help users track eating patterns and caloric trends over a seven-day period.
* **Personalized Diet Program**: Enables users to set daily calorie limits as a guideline for maintaining long-term health goals.

## Technology Stack
* **Programming Language**: Python.
* **Core Library**: **Kivy** (for cross-platform UI development).
* **Skills Demonstrated**: Python Programming, UI/UX Design, Analytical thinking, and clean code implementation.
